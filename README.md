Financial Portfolio Management System that allows users to track and analyze investments.

The system will be structured using ES6 JavaScript modules, focusing on reusability, modularity, and maintainability. Ill separate the code into modules for managing assets, calculating portfolio statistics, and simulating transactions, making it easier to extend as the portfolio grows.
